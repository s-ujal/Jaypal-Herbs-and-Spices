This repository contains my freelance project for Jaypal Herbs & Spices, where I designed and developed a professional website using HTML and CSS for the frontend and Django with REST API for the backend. The project also includes SEO optimization to improve search engine visibility and drive organic traffic. Key features include responsive design, dynamic content management, API-driven backend services, and optimized performance for enhanced user experience.
